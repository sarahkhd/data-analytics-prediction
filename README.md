# data-analytics-prediction
Created a K Nearest Neighbours model using data analysis techniques and python to predict the unknown values in a real bank data set.
The goal of this project was to predict whether or not customers of a real bank would subscribe to a term deposit or not, target attribute being subscribed.
The datasets were a test set and train set.
The datasets contained attributes such as: age: (numeric), job: (categorical), marital status: (categorical), education: (categorical), housing: (categorical), loan: (categorical), contact: (categorical), month: (categorical), day_of_week: (categorical), duration: (numeric), campaign: (numeric), pdays: (numeric), poutcome: (categorical), nr.employed: (numeric), Target Attribute: Subscribed (binary: 'yes','no'). 
This project included data exploration, data preprocessing, using a classification learning method and testing the learning method.
Precision of this model was 62%.
